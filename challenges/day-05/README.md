# Day 05

## Challenge description

Integrate Go Workspace with Bazel

## Getting Started

```bash
bazel build //challenges/day-05/main:build
bazel test //challenges/day-05/hello:ut_test
```

## Notices

### Go Workspace

I use Go Workspace to manage multiple Go modules, and it requires some manual steps to make it work:

```bash
go work use challenges/day-xxx
```

The `go work use` command adds a new module to the `go.work` file.

```bash
go work sync
```

The `go work sync` command syncs dependencies from the workspaceâ€™s build list into each of the workspace modules.
